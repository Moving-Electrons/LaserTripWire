# LaserTripWire

HomeKit compatible Laser trip wire using [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/) and [HomeBridge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge).  

When the laser beam between the emitter and the receptor is interrupted, it sends a notification to iOS devices through the Home App (HomeKit framework). This repository includes the CircuitPython code files and the needed files for 3D-printing the laser emitter support.
