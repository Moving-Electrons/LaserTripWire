# LaserTripWire

HomeKit compatible Laser trip wire using CircuitPython and HomeBridge. When the laser beam between an emitter and the receptor is interrupted, it sends out a notification to iOS devices through the Home App (HomeLit framework).

This repository includes CircuitPython code files in addition to the files for 3D-printing the laser emitter support.
